The clients have a receptive profile and a living room integrated into the dining room was a sophisticated and welcoming result, promoting well-being to everyone. Furthermore, the separation of the kitchen was essential to maintain the organization and elegance of those who enjoy their free time in the external area of the house. Maintaining neutral tones and adding color and life to the kitchen, I managed to remain elegant and comfortable in the environment, applying a well-designed lighting project to not weigh down the environment and take advantage of the wide openings. A delicate, sophisticated, and classic piece such as the piano was the main point during the development of the layout with a contemporary style."

Comfort was a priority and the headboard was applied to the ceiling to help the acoustics of the room that shares a wall with the bathroom, preventing any noise from being noticed. The blackout curtains provide privacy, in addition to balancing with the metal profiles in the furniture support and recamier. The closet and dressing table in the hallway were thought in the couple's daily routine, which demands agility and organization, so I opted with them the design of the furniture and their divisions. The same concept was used in the bathroom, where the cabinets were ornate with mirrors with metal profiles. Moreover, in the bathroom, the highlight is the shower where we made an opening to capture sunlight with glass closure, and lighting through the plaster cast provided an incredible result."

The designed beds are also essential and were thought with the tutors, considering the need for storage of toys, books, and games.
